# XSS_worm

The file worm.js constitutes the code for question 6 on the Cross Site Scripting lab accompanying Wenliang Du of Syracuse's SEED Ubuntu computer security lab environment.
The lab contains a social media site fraught with vulnerabilities, such that if the code in worm.js is pasted in a user's profile (on Text mode), it will insert a copy of itself into the profile of any visiting user. It will also propagate through the newly infected user, thus it furthers itself on the shoulders of normal user activity and has the potential to infect everyone on the site.
